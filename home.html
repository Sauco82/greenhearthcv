                <h2>Hi there Patrick, Daniel and Charlie!</h2>
                
                <div class="cover-letter__content">
                    <p>I'm Rafa, a Spanish developer with almost 7 years of working experience with HTML5 technologies, Ruby on Rails and  proper Javascript. I'm pretty knowledgeable about graphic design, usability and giving a good user experience.</p>
                    
                    <p>Creating videogames is something that has been itching me since I was a child. I would spend plenty of my time designing new concepts of videogames and gaming consoles or just hacking and trying the mechanics of non virtual games like <a href="http://www.games-workshop.com/gws/content/article.jsp?catId=&categoryId=&section=&pIndex=1&aId=2600002&start=2&multiPageMode=true">Mordheim</a>, <a href="http://www.games-workshop.com/MEDIA_CustomProductCatalog/m1340010_GorkaMorka_-_Da_Roolz.pdf">Gorkamorka</a> or <a href="http://whitewolf.wikia.com/wiki/Vampire:_The_Masquerade">Vampire The Masquerade</a>. </p>

                    <p>I play a lot of videogames of every genre with RPG probably being my favorite. Some of the games I have enjoyed the most are Ultima 7-8, Fallout Series, Elder Scrolls series, Monkey Island 1-3 and Heroes of Might & Magic Series (although the last one had an annoyingly simple plot and too many bugs or usability issues).</p>

                    <p>In these years I haven't dared to choose game development to make a living, instead I have used my creativity to develop enterprise applications and I do not regret it.</p> 
                    <p> I have a lot of fun coding and I've improved my skills to a quite good level. Still, developing videogames always had a special place in my (green) hearth, and since I watched <a href="http://buy.indiegamethemovie.com/">Indie Game the Movie</a> it has been itching more and more.</p>

                    <p>I discovered this offer while searching for ways to <a href="https://github.com/greenheartgames/greenworks">deploy HTML5 videogames in Steam</a> so you already made me happy once. Would you proceed to an interview and make me happy twice?</p>

                <p>I'm extremely creative. I have a high capability to solve problems by thinking outside of the box.</p>

                <p>I tend to mix my different skills in order to come with new ideas and new ways to solve issues, i.e. using psychology + design + frontend skills is possible to make an application feel much faster without improving the backend.</p>

                <p>In the time I was a Game Master at <a href="http://whitewolf.wikia.com/wiki/Vampire:_The_Masquerade">Vampire The Masquerade</a> or <a href="http://www.nosolorol.com/nuevo/index.php?page=shop.product_details&category_id=3&flypage=flypage-vmblend.tpl&product_id=39&option=com_virtuemart&Itemid=10">Aquelarre</a> I would just create some really basic elements for the story and then completely improvise everything. The result, my friends asking me to be the GM in further games.</p>

                <p>I've created several worlds, characters and stories and I've always been wanting to put them in videogames.</p>

                            <p>I tought that making an analysis of the things I found missing in the game would be reaaally boring.</p>
                            <p>So instead I just decided to prototype them up.</p>

                <p><em>Disclaimer:</em> the code is not precisely the most brilliant and maintainable piece I've ever written, being so time constrained I've focused on prototyping over everything.</p>

                <h3>I am in contact with several graphic designers</h3>
                <p>I have grown in a family with quite a lot of artists, and because of that I've been always quite close to the art & design scene.</p>
                <p>I have a handful of friends and familiars who are profesional artists and/or graphic designers, I'm even training some of them so that they know how to get into the world of game development and improve the necessary skills.</p>
                <p>All these close friends at the same time are in contact with a huge number of different artists that I could use if we had the need.</p>
