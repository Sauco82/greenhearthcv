                <div class="cover-letter__content">
                    <p>I'm Rafa a Spanish developer with almost 7 years of working experience with HTML5 technologies, Ruby on Rails and  proper Javascript. I'm pretty knowledgeable about graphic design, usability and giving a good user experience</p>
                    
                    <p>Creating videogames is something that has been itching me since I was a child. I would spent plenty of my time designing new concepts of videogames and gaming consoles or just hacking and trying the mechanics of non virtual games like <a href="http://www.games-workshop.com/gws/content/article.jsp?catId=&categoryId=&section=&pIndex=1&aId=2600002&start=2&multiPageMode=true">Mordheim</a>, <a href="http://www.games-workshop.com/MEDIA_CustomProductCatalog/m1340010_GorkaMorka_-_Da_Roolz.pdf">Gorkamorka</a> or <a href="http://whitewolf.wikia.com/wiki/Vampire:_The_Masquerade">Vampire The Masquerade</a> </p>

                    <p>I play a lot of videogames of every genre having a special place in my hearth for RPG, some of my favorite games are Ultima 7-8, Fallout Series, Elder Scrolls series, Monkey Island 1-3 and Heroes of Might & Magic Series (although the last one had an annoyingly simple plot and too many bugs or usability issues)</p>

                    <p>In these years I've not dared to choose game development as my career, and used my creativity to develop enterprise applications instead, I do not regret it. I've a lot of fun coding and I've improved my skills to a quite amazing level. Still, developing videogames always had a special place in my (green) hearth, and since I watched <a href="http://buy.indiegamethemovie.com/">Indie Game the Movie</a> it has been itching more and more.</p>

                <p>I'm extremely creative. I've a high capability to solve problems by thinking outside of the box.</p>

                <p>I tend to mix my different skills in order to come with new ideas and new ways to solve issues. I.E. using psycology + design + frontend skills is possible to make an application feel much faster without improving the backend.</p>

                <p>In the time I was a Game Master at Vampire the masquerade or <a href="http://www.nosolorol.com/nuevo/index.php?page=shop.product_details&category_id=3&flypage=flypage-vmblend.tpl&product_id=39&option=com_virtuemart&Itemid=10">Aquelarre</a> I would just create some really basic elements for the story and then completely improvise everything, the result would always be my friends asking me to be the GM in more games.</p>

                <p>I've created several worlds, characters and stories and I've been always wanting to put them in videogames.</p>

                <h3>I really wanted to impress you with some prototypes, but the deadline caught me by surprise</h3>
                <p>Drawing has been my hobby since I was a child, and I always like to have a pencil, an eraser and paper at hand, I'm able to make pretty decent drawings and I'm really efficient at creating mocks on paper or a whiteboard.</p>
                <p><strong>Here</strong> you have a few mocks of a game that mixes the mechanics of a runner + Devil May Cry combos to create an intense, fast paced casual game </p>

                <h3>I was considering to buy your game, and I did</h3>
                <p> The job offer finally triggered my decision to buy the game, and now I would like to show some interface suggestions. Please play with it!</p>

                            <p>I tought that making an analysis of the things I found missing in the game would be reaaally boring.</p>
                            <p>So instead I just decided to prototype them up.</p>
                        </div>
                        <button class="popup__button" onclick="startGame()">Show 'em to me!</button>

                    </ul>
                </div>
                <p>Disclaimer: the code is not precisely the most brilliant and maintainable piece I've ever written, being so time constrained I've focused on prototyping over everything.</p>

                <h3>I'm in contact with several graphic designers</h3>
                <p>I have a handful of friends and familiars who are profesional artists and/or graphic designers, I'm even trainig some of them so they know how to get into the world of game development. </p>
                <p>All these close friends at the same time are in contact with a huge number of different artists that I could use if we had the need.</p>
